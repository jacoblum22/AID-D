## ✅ Currently Implemented

### 1. Game State System (`game_state.py`)

**Core Data Structures:**
- `Zone`: Game locations with adjacency
- `HP`: Health point tracking  
- `Stats`: D&D ability scores
- `BaseEntity`: Base class for all game entities

**Entity Types (Discriminated Union):**
- `PC`: Player characters with stats, HP, inventory, combat fields
- `NPC`: Non-player characters with same capabilities as PCs
- `ObjectEntity`: Environmental objects (doors, chests, etc.)
- `ItemEntity`: Pickupable items with weight/value

**Scene Management:**
- `Scene`: Turn order, round tracking, environmental tags (alert/lighting/noise/cover)
- `GameState`: Central state container with entities, zones, scene, clocks

**Features:**
- Backward compatibility with `actors` property
- Strict Pydantic validation
- Comprehensive entity modeling

### 2. Tool Catalog System (`tool_catalog.py`)

**Tool Infrastructure:**
- `Tool`: Core tool definition with preconditions and schema
- `ToolArgs`: Base class for all tool arguments
- Precondition functions for tool availability
- Argument suggestion functions

**Implemented Tools (9 total):**

#### ✅ **ask_roll** (Fully Implemented)
- Complete dice mechanics with Style+Domain system
- DC derivation and effect generation  
- Comprehensive validation pipeline
- **Status**: Production ready

#### ✅ **narrate_only** (Fully Implemented)
- Complete topic inference system (look around, listen, smell, recap, zoom_in, establishing)
- Sophisticated narration generation with contextual details
- POV management and visibility rules
- Scene tag integration for atmosphere and tone
- Comprehensive test coverage
- **Status**: Production ready

#### 🚧 **Placeholder Implementations:**
- `move`: Basic zone transitions
- `attack`: Simple combat mechanics  
- `talk`: Basic social interactions
- `use_item`: Basic item usage
- `get_info`: State querying
- `apply_effects`: Direct effect application
- `ask_clarifying`: Clarification requests

**Features:**
- Dynamic precondition checking
- Intelligent argument suggestion
- Extensible tool registry

### 3. Effects System (`effects.py`)

**Effect Registry:**
- Decorator-based effect registration
- Extensible handler system

**Implemented Effect Types (5 total):**
- `hp`: Health point changes with bounds checking
- `position`: Entity zone movement with visibility updates
- `clock`: Clock value updates with min/max clamping
- `guard`: Protection status with duration tracking
- `mark`: Bonus/mark application with consumption tracking

**Features:**
- Atomic effect application
- Type-safe entity handling
- Automatic visibility management
- Immutable state updates via Pydantic

### 4. Validator System (`validator.py`)

**Core Components:**
- `ToolResult`: Standardized result envelope
- Schema validation with Pydantic
- Precondition checking
- Tool execution framework
- Structured logging

**Features:**
- Comprehensive error handling
- JSON serializable results
- Deterministic execution tracking

### 5. Narration System (`narrate_only` tool)

**Fully Implemented:**
- Complete topic inference system (look around, listen, smell, recap, zoom_in, establishing)
- Sophisticated narration generation with contextual details
- POV management and visibility rules  
- Scene tag integration for atmosphere and tone
- Camera angle and sensory focus determination
- Comprehensive test coverage

**Features:**
- Template-based deterministic narration
- Context-aware topic detection from utterances
- Structured narration hints for future LLM integration
- No state mutation (pure narration)

### 6. Router Components

**Implemented:**
- `affordances.py`: Tool availability checking
- `planner.py`: Tool selection logic
- Core router infrastructure

### 7. Test Suite (Comprehensive)

**Test Coverage:**
- `test_affordances.py`
- `test_ask_roll.py` 
- `test_effects.py`
- `test_game_state.py`
- `test_narrate_only.py`
- `test_planner.py`
- `test_tool_catalog.py` 
- `test_validator.py`

**Features:**
- Unit tests for all major components
- Integration tests for tool execution
- Effect system validation
- State management verification

## 🚧 Partially Implemented

### Router System
- Basic infrastructure exists
- Tool selection and execution working
- **Missing**: Full integration with world state

- **Missing**: LLM enhancement layer with validation and fallbacks

## ❌ Not Yet Implemented (From Vision)

### 1. AGS (Authoritative Game State)
- **Current**: Basic `GameState` class
- **Missing**: SDK interface, snapshots, persistence layer

### 2. RRE (Rules/Resolution Engine)
- **Current**: Rules embedded in individual tools
- **Missing**: Centralized resolution engine, banding system

### 3. World Model / KB (Knowledge Base)
- **Missing**: Entity cards, relationship graphs, truth levels
- **Missing**: `lore_snippet()` API, persistence

### 4. Narrative Controller  
- **Missing**: Scene goals, tone tracking, beat hints
- **Missing**: Pacing metrics and spotlight management

### 5. Persistence Layer
- **Missing**: JSON snapshots, turn logs, world deltas
- **Missing**: SQLite/Postgres backend

### 6. Advanced Narration
- **Missing**: Template system
- **Missing**: LLM narrator with validation
- **Missing**: Fallback mechanisms

### 7. Observability
- **Missing**: Structured turn logging
- **Missing**: Replay system  
- **Missing**: Debug tooling

## Dependencies

From `requirements.txt`:
```
pydantic>=2.0.0
pytest>=7.0.0
# Additional dependencies for AI integration (future)
```

## Development Status

### What Works Now
- Game state management and entity modeling
- Tool system with **two fully-featured tools** (`ask_roll` and `narrate_only`)
- Effect system for state changes
- Validation and execution pipeline  
- Comprehensive testing

### What's Ready for Enhancement
- Tool implementations (move, attack, talk, etc. - 7 remaining placeholder tools)
- Persistence and logging
- World state management

### Architecture Decisions Made
- Pydantic for type safety and validation
